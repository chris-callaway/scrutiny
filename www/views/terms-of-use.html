        part in any such activities.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>We understand that anonymity requires responsibility, and it is Our sincere hope that You use the App for good
        and that You do not use it to bully, abuse, or harass other, which is a violation of this Agreement and may
        result in You being denied access to the App.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><a style="color: #000;" href="#/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>ACCESS TO THE APP AND SITE</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>2.1.&nbsp; </strong>To access the App&rsquo;s features, You may be asked to provide certain registration
        details or other information (&ldquo;Registration Data&rdquo;). It is a condition of Your use of this Site and
        Services that all the information You provide through the Site, including Registration Data, will be correct,
        current, and complete. If We believe the information You provide is not correct, current, or complete, We have
        the right to refuse you access to the App or Services, and to terminate or suspend Your account at any time.</p>

    <p><strong>2.2.&nbsp; </strong>Some of the Registration Data You provide, as well as other of Your Content, as
        defined below, may be personal, private, or otherwise sensitive.&nbsp; It is Your responsibility to keep that
        information up to date and accurate.&nbsp; While we use commercially reasonable efforts to protect all
        information which You provide to Us, it may be technically impossible to prevent determined third-party hackers,
        phishers, or scammers from obtaining such information through nefarious means.&nbsp; For that reason, We cannot
        be responsible for the intentional and criminal acts of those third parties, nor can We be responsible for Your
        negligence with regard to Your Content, including the Registration Data.</p>

    <p><strong>2.3.&nbsp; </strong>You are responsible for all activity transpiring under Your account.&nbsp; We
        disclaim any and all liability arising from fraudulent use of the App and Services.&nbsp; Given Our commitment
        to security, We may terminate, suspend, or otherwise cancel any account that appears, in Our sole discretion, to
        be engaging in fraudulent or suspicious use.</p>

    <p><strong>2.4.&nbsp; </strong>Since You are responsible for all activity transpiring under Your account, You agree
        that You will immediately notify Us should You suspect that there has been any unauthorized activity associated
        with Your account or other use of the App or Services.</p>

    <p><strong>2.5.&nbsp; </strong>Subject to Your acceptance of this Agreement, We grant You a limited, nonexclusive,
        nontransferable personal license to access and use the App and the Services.&nbsp; This license is not a sale of
        the App or Services.&nbsp; All rights to the App and Services not expressly granted to You are reserved by Us.&nbsp;
        Unless otherwise terminated by You due to Your deletion of the App, or otherwise terminated by Us under this
        Agreement, this license shall remain in effect for as long as We provide the App and Services to You and You use
        the Services.</p>

    <p><strong>2.6.&nbsp; </strong>By using the App and Services, and by assenting to this Agreement by Your use of the
        App and Services, You hereby affirmatively consent to receiving messages from other users, with the
        understanding that such messages or content may contain offensive or otherwise objectionable content.&nbsp; You
        also agree and understand that to protect the integrity and mission of the App, which is to allow anonymous
        messaging, unless ordered to do so as outlined in Our Privacy Policy, We will not disclose to You the identity
        of the sender of any message sent through Our App, to the extent that We know such identity.</p>

    <p><strong>2.7.&nbsp; </strong>You agree that You must keep all billing information current throughout Your use of
        the App and Services.&nbsp; If We are unable to receive any payment due to Us because You failed to update such
        payment information with the applicable payment processor, We have the right to suspend, terminate, or otherwise
        disable Your account.&nbsp; You agree that You are responsible for any chargebacks or other fees that We may
        incur while trying to process Your payment(s).</p>

    <p><strong>2.8.&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Termination of Your Access</span>:</p>

    <p><strong>2.8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>We may suspend or terminate Your access to the App and Services,
        without notice, if You, in Our discretion, have breached any provision of this Agreement, or the policies and
        other documents incorporated by reference.</p>

    <p><strong>2.8.2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Additionally, we reserve the right to cease operations of the App
        and Services at any time and for any reason, and You agree that such cessation will be without liability or harm
        to You.</p>

    <p><strong>2.8.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>You understand and agree that We shall not be liable to Your for
        any reason in the event that We suspend, terminate, or otherwise cancel Your access to the App and Services.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p><strong>2.9.&nbsp; </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Service Interruptions</span>: Due to
        factors outside of Our control, as well as certain factors within Our control, such as software and hardware
        upgrades, the App may be temporarily unavailable.&nbsp; You agree to hold Us harmless for any such interruption,
        whether or not such interruption was planned and whether or not We notified You of any interruption.</p>

    <p><strong>2.10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><span
            style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Links</span>: The Site and App may be hyperlinked to other
        sites which are not maintained by, or related to Our Site or app. Links to such sites are provided as a service
        to Our Users and are not sponsored by or affiliated with Us. We likely have not reviewed any or all of such
        sites and We are not responsible for the content of those sites. You access such third-party sites at Your own
        risk, and We make no representations or warranties about the content, completeness or accuracy of these links or
        the sites linked to this Site and Services. We provide links as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link to
        a third-party site does not necessarily imply Our endorsement of such site.&nbsp; Third party sites are subject
        to their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

    <p><strong>3.4.&nbsp; </strong><strong>Section 230 Notice</strong>: Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. &sect; 230 (the &ldquo;Communications

    <p><strong>3.5.&nbsp; </strong>By accepting this Agreement and using the App or Services, We grant You a single
        limited, revocable, nonexclusive and nontransferable license to access and use the Site Materials. The App,
        Services, and Site Materials are for Your personal, non-commercial use only.&nbsp; Should We terminate Your
        account or access to the App, Site or Services, the license granted in this paragraph shall immediately
        terminate and any continued access or use of the App, Site, Services, or Site Materials shall be unauthorized.&nbsp;
        The Site Material and certain other content accessible from the Site and Services is the proprietary information
        of Company or the party that provided or licensed the content to Company, whereby such providing party retains
        all right, title, and interest in such content. Accordingly, the Site Materials may not be copied, distributed,
        republished, uploaded, posted, or transmitted in any way without Our prior written consent. Modification or use
        of the Site Materials except as expressly provided in this Agreement violates Our intellectual property rights.
        Neither title nor intellectual property rights are transferred to You by using the App, Site or Services.</p>

    <p><strong>3.6.&nbsp; </strong>We respect the intellectual property rights of others, and We have developed and

        Copyright Act.&nbsp; Copies of our Repeat Infringer Policy are available upon request to Our Users.</p>

    <p><strong>3.7.&nbsp; </strong>You understand and acknowledge that the App does not have the capacity to store or
        produce telephone numbers to be called or texted using a random or sequential number generator.&nbsp; All calls,
        texts, and other transmissions via the App are initiated solely by You, the user of the App, via Your entry of,
        or provision of, the recipient&rsquo;s telephone number or other destination address.&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>3.8.&nbsp; </strong>Additional Features:&nbsp; As explained above, the App and/or Site may allow You to

        may access the address book on Your mobile device to present You with a list of contacts which You may wish to
        contact.&nbsp; You understand and agree that any promotion or use of the Services is done solely at Your
        discretion and that You will not receive anything of value from Us based on Your unilateral promotion of the
        Services or for Your requests to Your contacts that they use the App or Services.&nbsp; Any e-mail or text that
        You send from within the App originates from You, not Us.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><strong>3.8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>By using such features, including any SNS integration or sending
        e-mail or other messages to Your address book contacts or any other number, You expressly give Us permission to
